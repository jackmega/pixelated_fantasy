				<div class='item-content'>
					<p class='item-p'>Hi, I'm Jack Smith. I have many hobbies including; archery, Dungeons and Dragons, board games, card games, video games, tae-kwon-do, and more. I have done archery since I was four, I shoot Olympic Style Recurve and was a member of Junior Olympic Archery Development (JOAD) for a time. I have played Dungeons and Dragons since the fall of 2016; I prefer to be the Dungeon Master (DM), although I do like to play. I have played board and card games for as long as I can remember, my favorite board game is Monopoly. I love video games and built my own computer to play them, I have a GTX 1060 with 3GB of VRAM, 16GB of RAM, I have a 1TB and a 2TB hard drives. I have done tae-kwon-do since I was eight, now I teach children tae-kwon-do for eight or nine hours a week.</p>

			<p class='item-title'>How I Record</p>
				<div class='item-content'>
					<p class='item-p'>I record with an Audio-Technica AT2035 microphone which is connected to my Behringer U-PHORIA UMC22 Audio Interface. My interface is then connected to my laptop which runs the most recent edition of Adobe Audition. For scripts I use my iPad mini along with PDFs or Google Docs for the scripts themselves; my iPad has a mount that connects to my microphone stand. To monitor my microphone, I use my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Monitor Headphones. I record in my closet that I have treated with moving blankets to help catch any reflected sound.</p>
					<p class='item-p'>After I record on my laptop, I save as a wav file on a flash drive or external hard drive; which I then take down to my computer where I edit it with beefier, yet louder hardware.  I edit my audio in Adobe Audition; my editing process includes removing what little background noise is in the file and applying minor effects to my voice, such as hard limiting. After these edits, I export the project into a lossless wav file format.</p>

			<p class='item-title'>My Voice</p>
				<div class='item-content'>
					<p class='item-p'>My voice can be deep, fun, serious, ominous, and more. I also have some accents at my disposal including a posh English accent, think of the BBC, a much less posh English accent, think London, an Irish accent and more. I have developed these accents from years of listening to English and Irish people talking in their ‘native’ accent. My natural voice is based on where I am located which is in the Western United States. I have yet to take any voice acting or voice over classes, I am planning on taking some shortly.</p>
					<p class='item-p'>As mentioned previously, I play and enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, which is where I take time to practice and hone my different voices and accents.</p>

				<div class='item-content'>
					<p class='item-p'>If you would like me to do any voice over or voice acting for a project of yours, please note that I am not interested in audio books that are longer than 1 hour, or any radio work. I am willing to send you a raw (unedited) voice file, an edited voice file, a complete audio track (music included if supplied). I can send you these files through email, or if you have a recording studio near me (contact me if this is the case and we can attempt to work something out) I can come to the studio and record there. I only accept payment through PayPal, and I will need proof of payment before a complete file is sent. I will send you near complete files during the recording and editing process to ensure you are receiving exactly the product you want.</p>
